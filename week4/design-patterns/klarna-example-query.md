# Klarna AI Assistant: Example Query Flow

## Sample Case: Return and Refund Inquiry

### 1. Initial User Input
```
Input: "I returned my Nike shoes to the store last week but haven't received my refund yet. Order #KLA-123456"
```

### 2. Pre-Processing & Query Analysis
**Input Classification:**
```json
{
    "query_type": "refund_status",
    "channel": "web_interface",
    "language": "en",
    "priority": "standard",
    "category": "returns_and_refunds",
    "order_reference": "KLA-123456"
}
```

**Context Enrichment:**
```json
{
    "customer_context": {
        "order_history": {
            "order_id": "KLA-123456",
            "purchase_date": "2024-01-25",
            "merchant": "Nike",
            "amount": 129.99,
            "payment_method": "klarna_pay_later",
            "return_initiated": "2024-02-01"
        },
        "customer_status": "active",
        "previous_interactions": 2
    }
}
```

### 3. Intent & Entity Extraction

**NLP Processing Results:**
```json
{
    "primary_intent": "refund_status_check",
    "secondary_intent": "return_confirmation",
    "entities": {
        "product": "Nike shoes",
        "action": "returned",
        "timeframe": "last week",
        "order_id": "KLA-123456",
        "location": "store"
    },
    "sentiment": "neutral_concerned"
}
```

### 4. Query Routing

**Route Classification:**
```json
{
    "route_type": "simple_faq",
    "confidence_score": 0.92,
    "processing_path": "automated_resolution",
    "required_integrations": [
        "order_management_system",
        "refund_processing_system",
        "merchant_api"
    ]
}
```

### 5. Context Enrichment & Retrieval

**System Checks:**
```json
{
    "return_status": {
        "return_received": true,
        "receipt_date": "2024-02-03",
        "condition_verified": true,
        "refund_initiated": true,
        "refund_status": "processing"
    },
    "payment_details": {
        "original_payment_method": "klarna_pay_later",
        "refund_method": "original_payment_method",
        "expected_processing_time": "3-5 business days"
    }
}
```

### 6. GPT-4 Processing

**Conversation Context:**
```json
{
    "user_history": {
        "issue_type": "refund_inquiry",
        "interaction_count": 1,
        "previous_resolutions": []
    },
    "response_requirements": {
        "include_timeline": true,
        "provide_next_steps": true,
        "add_tracking_info": true
    }
}
```

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**
```text
1. Verify return receipt and status
2. Check refund processing stage
3. Calculate expected timeline
4. Provide clear next steps
5. Add proactive service elements
```

### 7. Response Generation

**Draft Response:**
```text
I can see that your return for the Nike shoes (Order #KLA-123456) was received at the store on February 3rd. The refund has been initiated and is currently processing. Since you paid with Klarna Pay Later, the refund will be applied to your Klarna account within 3-5 business days from the return receipt date.

You should see the refund reflected in your Klarna account by February 8th. I'll update your bill right away to reflect the pending refund.

Is there anything else you need help with?
```

### 8. Confidence Check

**Validation Results:**
```json
{
    "accuracy_check": {
        "order_details_correct": true,
        "timeline_accurate": true,
        "policy_compliant": true
    },
    "response_quality": {
        "completeness": 0.95,

        "tone": "appropriate",
        "solution_provided": true
    },
    "confidence_score": 0.94
}
```

### 9. Response Delivery & Monitoring

**Delivery Metrics:**
```json
{
    "response_time": "1.8s",
    "channel": "web_interface",
    "language": "en",
    "resolution_status": "completed",
    "follow_up_required": false

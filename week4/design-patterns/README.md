# AI System Design Patterns

This directory contains architectural patterns and detailed examples of real-world AI systems, focusing on how large language models (LLMs) are implemented in production environments. The examples are based on documented implementations from companies like Harvey and Klarna.

  - AI-powered customer service system
  - Multi-language support (35+ languages)
  - Processing paths for different query types
  - Performance metrics showing 2.3M conversations handled
  - Integration with existing systems

- **Example Implementation**: [klarna-example-query.md](klarna-example-query.md)
  - Detailed flow of a customer support interaction
  - NLP processing and intent extraction
  - Response generation and validation
  - Monitoring and feedback systems

## Key Learning Points

1. **System Architecture**
   - How to structure large-scale AI systems
   - Integration patterns with existing infrastructure
   - Security and compliance considerations
   - Monitoring and quality control

2. **AI Model Implementation**
   - Custom model training approaches
   - Integration of multiple AI models
   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) patterns
   - Chain-of-thought processing

3. **Real-world Performance**
   - Actual metrics from production systems
   - Response time optimization
   - Accuracy and quality measurements
   - Cost and efficiency improvements

4. **Best Practices**
   - Error handling and validation
   - Scalability considerations
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Continuous improvement processes

## How to Use This Content

1. Start with the architecture overview files (`harvey.md` and `klarna.md`) to understand the high-level system design
2. Review the example query files to see how the systems process actual requests
3. Study the flow diagrams in the `images` directory to visualize the system interactions
4. Compare the different approaches used by each company to solve similar problems
